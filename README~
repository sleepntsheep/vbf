brainf**k interpreter and visualizer in C

note: this is early WIP, the code is horrible and don't read it please

installation:
    git clone https://github.com/sleepntsheep/vbf
    cd vbf
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo cp ./vbf /usr/local/bin

** if you're compiling in windows, where ncurses might not be present
   pass -DHAVE_NCURSES=0 to cmake

    refactor code
